    <h2>Portland Temple—A Landmark for Northwestern Saints</h2>
    <h4>By Louise R. Shaw</h4>

    <div class="news">

    <p>Mount Hood rises to 11,235 feet just east of Portland, Oregon, providing a spectacular backdrop to the city and a favorite retreat for the area’s 1.4 million residents.

    <p>Mount St. Helens, remembered for its devastating volcanic eruption in 1980, is also visible from Portland across the Oregon/Washington border to the north.</p>
            
    <p>Portlanders take great pride in their environment. Nourished by thirty-seven inches of rain a year, the metropolitan area boasts firs and ferns, rhododendrons and roses in amazing abundance. Timber, tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing are major industries in the area.</p>
            
    <p>The wide, slow-moving Willamette and Columbia rivers add to the beauty and the recreation available in this section of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
            
    <p>The newest landmark in the metropolitan area is the Portland Oregon Temple, now completed in the suburban community of Lake Oswego, about ten miles southwest of Portland’s city center.</p>

    <p>Six temple spires—the highest of which is 170 feet and is topped by a statue of the angel Moroni—can be seen for miles around, towering above the surrounding alder and fir trees. Although motorists on Interstate 5 can see the temple itself only briefly, those who drive to the site and walk the landscaped grounds are overwhelmed at its magnificence.</p>

    <p>“People will just stand there and gaze at it,” said Elder Glen B. Lewis of Tucson, Arizona, a full-time missionary who spends evenings and weekends answering visitors’ questions at the temple grounds. “They are really overcome by the beauty of it. They comment on how well it sits in its environment and fits in with the trees.”</p>

    <p>The land the temple stands on was purchased by the Church thirty years ago. Ground breaking on the 7.29-acre site took place on 20 September 1986, by President Gordon B. Hinckley, two years after plans for the temple were announced.</p>

    <p>The Portland Temple, the Church’s forty-second temple, is constructed of white Vermont marble with green Vermont slate on the roof and as trim. Dark-stained mahogany borders the windows and doors inside, with gold- and silver-leaf detailing throughout. Its 82,000 square feet include four ordinance rooms, fourteen sealing rooms, a baptistry, a celestial room, offices, a cafeteria, and a nursery.</p>

    <p>“It is a masterpiece of workmanship,” said Daniel M. Florea, an Oregon artist and hotel designer. Although he is not LDS, he feels that the structure “signifies all that is good in expressions of a love of God. It shows that people who make up the Mormon Church are really trying to be the best they can be and will not be second-best in their architecture, in the quality of the materials they use, or in their lives.”</p>

    <p>The enthusiasm of local members is also strong, not only for the structure itself, but also for what it means in their lives...</p>
